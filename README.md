<h2>Structure</h2>

<p>The landing page is structured using the BEM methodology, which stands for Block, Element, Modifier. This methodology is a way of organizing CSS code that makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>

<p>The landing page consists of several different blocks, including the header, navigation section, recommended section, categories section, about us section and contacts.</p>

<p>In addition to the BEM methodology and SCSS, the landing page also utilizes the AOS (Animate On Scroll) JavaScript library to add some animation effects. AOS is a lightweight library that allows you to animate elements as they come into view, adding some interactivity to the page without being too distracting.</p>

<p>To ensure consistent code formatting, the landing page also utilizes Stylelint, a CSS linter that checks your code for syntax errors and style violations.</p>
